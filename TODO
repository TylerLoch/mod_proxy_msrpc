TODO list

When I implemented mod_proxy_msrpc, I took some notes about what might need to
get improved later (e.g. to improve the code structure, style, or what ever).
This file is an unstructured collection of such TODO items:

- get rid of libuuid (APR provides that functionality too)

- review sync files location

- invalidate established tunnel on client/server disconnect

- review session cache

- track used backend and save it in a hash table using the
  AssociationId so that load balancing is done correctly
