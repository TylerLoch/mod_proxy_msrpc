mod-proxy-msrpc (0.5-2) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Upload to experimental because I don't know whether this change will
    get a freeze exception for Debian Jessie.
  * Add patch upstream-big-endian-patch.diff to fix build on big endian
    architectures (closes: #774285). This essentially updates the source to
    upstream Git commit 03ed564ee88b1a35e830c4f141e178125010c265 (all changes
    since the release 0.5 were only related to big-endian support).

mod-proxy-msrpc (0.5-1) unstable; urgency=medium

    patch via Ubuntu.
