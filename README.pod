=head1 NAME

mod_proxy_msrpc - Apache module for Outlook Anywhere support in reverse proxy setups

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Build the module:

    apxs -luuid -c mod_proxy_msrpc.c msrpc_pdu_parser.c msrpc_sync.c

Load the module:

    LoadModule proxy_msrpc_module /path/to/your/mod_proxy_msrpc.so

Enable the module inside a <VirtualHost> configuration container (or globally):

    OutlookAnywherePassthrough On

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module intends to make Apache httpd work in a reverse proxy setup
in front of a MS Exchange server offering Outlook Anywhere services.
Without it, Apache would block any Outlook Anywhere requests for reasons
documented very well in https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=40029.

=head1 CAVEATS

The module focuses only on the traffic that is handled by HTTP alike requests
using RPC_IN_DATA and RPC_OUT_DATA methods.
Some older Exchange versions (e.g. Exchange Server 2007) are known to sync
offline address books and calendar information via other protocols.
For these Exchange versions functionality of this module is limited to
enabling receiving and sending mail.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

If you encounter any problems, you can set following directive:

    LogLevel info proxy_msrpc:trace2

This will enable detailed debug logging for the proxy_msrpc module, which will
be written to the usual Apache log destinations (e.g. to file error.log).
